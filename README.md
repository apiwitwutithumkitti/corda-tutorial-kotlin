# CorDapp Template - Kotlin

Welcome to the Kotlin CorDapp template. The CorDapp template is a stubbed-out CorDapp that you can use to bootstrap 
your own CorDapps.

**This is the Kotlin version of the CorDapp template. The Java equivalent is 
[here](https://github.com/corda/cordapp-template-java/).**

# Pre-Requisites

See https://docs.corda.net/getting-set-up.html.

# Usage

## Running tests inside IntelliJ

We recommend editing your IntelliJ preferences so that you use the Gradle runner - this means that the quasar utils
plugin will make sure that some flags (like ``-javaagent`` - see below) are
set for you.

To switch to using the Gradle runner:

* Navigate to ``Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Runner`` (or search for `runner`)
  * Windows: this is in "Settings"
  * MacOS: this is in "Preferences"
* Set "Delegate IDE build/run actions to gradle" to true
* Set "Run test using:" to "Gradle Test Runner"

If you would prefer to use the built in IntelliJ JUnit test runner, you can run ``gradlew installQuasar`` which will
copy your quasar JAR file to the lib directory. You will then need to specify ``-javaagent:lib/quasar.jar``
and set the run directory to the project root directory for each test.

## Running the nodes

See https://docs.corda.net/tutorial-cordapp.html#running-the-example-cordapp.

## Interacting with the nodes

### Shell

When started via the command line, each node will display an interactive shell:

    Welcome to the Corda interactive shell.
    Useful commands include 'help' to see what is available, and 'bye' to shut down the node.
    
    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>>

You can use this shell to interact with your node. For example, enter `run networkMapSnapshot` to see a list of 
the other nodes on the network:

    Tue Nov 06 11:58:13 GMT 2018>>> run networkMapSnapshot
    [
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10002" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=Notary, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505484825
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10005" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyA, L=London, C=GB" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505382560
    },
      {
      "addresses" : [ "localhost:10008" ],
      "legalIdentitiesAndCerts" : [ "O=PartyB, L=New York, C=US" ],
      "platformVersion" : 3,
      "serial" : 1541505384742
    }
    ]
    
    Tue Nov 06 12:30:11 GMT 2018>>> 

You can find out more about the node shell [here](https://docs.corda.net/shell.html).

### Client

`clients/src/main/kotlin/com/template/Client.kt` defines a simple command-line client that connects to a node via RPC 
and prints a list of the other nodes on the network.

#### Running the client

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateClient` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Client` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`.

### Webserver

`clients/src/main/kotlin/com/template/webserver/` defines a simple Spring webserver that connects to a node via RPC and 
allows you to interact with the node over HTTP.

The API endpoints are defined here:

     clients/src/main/kotlin/com/template/webserver/Controller.kt

And a static webpage is defined here:

     clients/src/main/resources/static/

#### Running the webserver

##### Via the command line

Run the `runTemplateServer` Gradle task. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` with 
the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

##### Via IntelliJ

Run the `Run Template Server` run configuration. By default, it connects to the node with RPC address `localhost:10006` 
with the username `user1` and the password `test`, and serves the webserver on port `localhost:10050`.

#### Interacting with the webserver

The static webpage is served on:

    http://localhost:10050

While the sole template endpoint is served on:

    http://localhost:10050/templateendpoint
    
# Extending the template

You should extend this template as follows:

* Add your own state and contract definitions under `contracts/src/main/kotlin/`
* Add your own flow definitions under `workflows/src/main/kotlin/`
* Extend or replace the client and webserver under `clients/src/main/kotlin/`

For a guided example of how to extend this template, see the Hello, World! tutorial 
[here](https://docs.corda.net/hello-world-introduction.html).

# The story
This example showcases a delivery versus payment (DvP) scenario. You are building a CorDapp for an apple orchard that wants to offer a way for customers to purchase a voucher that they will later redeem for a bushel of apples.

There are two parties involved in this transaction:

The owner of the orchard - Farmer Bob.
A customer - letâ€™s call him Peter.
Your CorDapp must follow this process:

1. Farmer Bob creates and issues a voucher to Peter for the apples he wishes to buy.
2. Farmer Bob prepares the amount of apples Peter requested.
3. Peter goes to the orchard to pick up his apples and redeems his voucher.
4. The voucher is marked as spent and Farmer Bob gives Peter his apples.
5. An important feature of this CorDapp is that the voucher cannot be used more than once. It must be considered invalid after it is redeemed.

# How will it work on Corda?
1. Farmer Bob issues a voucher to Peter via a ledger transaction. In your CorDapp this voucher is called AppleStamp and is a state on the ledger . One transaction has been performed so far.
2. When Farmer Bob prepares the apples Peter requested, he self-issues a bushel of apples via a self-issue transaction. This is another state on the ledger - BasketofApples. Two transactions have been performed so far.
3. Next, Peter goes to the orchard to pick up his apples and redeems his voucher, triggering a transaction on the ledger that consumes the AppleStamp state. Three transactions have been performed so far.
4. The BasketofApples state is transferred to Peter when the AppleStamp state is consumed and Farmer Bob gives Peter his apples.

All of these transactions are initiated by flows.
